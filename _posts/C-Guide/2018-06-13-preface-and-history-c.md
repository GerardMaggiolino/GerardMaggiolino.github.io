<p class="head1"><b>Goal and Target audience</b></p>
The goal of this guide is to provide a syntax based introduction to the C 
language for beginner to intermediate programmers. While links to explanatory 
resources may be provided, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with 
basic control flow and generic features of higher level languages. The ideal 
reader will have completed at least one introductory course in programming 
with Java, Python, C#, or other related language. Rather than providing 
extensive exercises, this guide will look to transition oneâ€™s existing
programming knowledge into the realm of C.
